  summary: Update an expense
  description: |
    Updates an expense. Parameters are the same as in `create_expense`, but you only need to include parameters
    that are changing from the previous values. If any values is supplied for `users__{index}__{property}`, _all_
    shares for the expense will be overwritten with the provided values.

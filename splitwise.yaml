    # Introduction
    Hey there! We're glad you're interested in the Splitwise API. This documentation will help you to fetch information
    on users, expenses, groups, and much more.

    If something in the API is confusing you, you can open an issue about it [on GitHub](https://github.com/splitwise/api-docs).
    We're a small team, so we may not have an instant fix, but we'll get back to you as soon as we're able.
    (If you spot an issue in our API documentation itself, feel free to open a pull request to update this website!)

    # Third-Party SDKs

    # Terms of Use

    ## Overview

    Splitwise provides this Self-Serve API to facilitate integrations with third-party applications, as well as open-up functionality for hobbyists and power users to programmatically interact with their own Splitwise account and build plugins or other tools.

    If you’re interested in integrating your commercial application with Splitwise, we strongly encourage you to contact developers@splitwise.com so our development team can help discuss your use case, provide private APIs and Enterprise support, and offer an appropriate  commercial license for the integration. The Self-Serve API documented here may be suitable for internal prototyping and other exploratory work.

    If you are developing a non-commercial plugin application or personal project, we recommend you make use of the Self-Serve API documented here under the API Terms Of Use. Please be aware that our Self-Serve API has conservative rate and access limits, which are subject to change at any time and not well suited to commercial projects. If this is a problem for your use case, please contact us at developers@splitwise.com to discuss your needs.

        Splitwise uses OAuth 2 with the authorization code flow. To connect via OAuth 2, you'll need to [register your app](https://secure.splitwise.com/apps). When you register, you'll be given a key and secret.

        **Note**: OAuth can be a very confusing protocol to implement correctly, and we **strongly** recommend
        that you use an existing OAuth library to connect to Splitwise. You can find a list of OAuth client libraries at the
        [OAuth community site](https://oauth.net/code/#client-libraries).

        For more information on using OAuth, check out the following resources:

        - The OAuth community [getting started guide](https://oauth.net/getting-started/)
        - The oauth.com [OAuth 2.0 playground](https://www.oauth.com/playground/) (great for debugging authorization issues)
        - This [old Splitwise blog post](https://blog.splitwise.com/2013/07/15/setting-up-oauth-for-the-splitwise-api/) about OAuth
      flows:
        authorizationCode:

    ApiKeyAuth:
      type: http
      description:
        For speed and ease of prototyping, you can generate a personal API key on your app's details page. You should present this key to the server via the Authorization header as a Bearer token. The API key is an access token for your personal account, so keep it as safe as you would a password.

        If your key becomes compromised or you want to invalidate your existing key for any other reason, you can do so on the app details page by generating a new key.
